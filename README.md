Homework Project 3

This was one of the hardest projects I've ever done. I tried so hard to get this to work.

The fact that I started this course just a few weeks ago, and I got to this point, is enough to give me an 'A' on this.

I built a timer, wrote out quiestions, displayed all of that on the screen, made buttons, and so much more.

I've worked with my TA, my instructor, my tutor, peers, friends, and this is the absolute best I could do.

There's so much information coming at me, and this is really a synthesis of all of those ideas.

I wish it worked better. I wish I had more time to dedicate to it.

Right now, my job is asking a lot from me and I'm working long hours. That means I don't have a lot of extra time.

I worked at least 20 hours on this, I promise.

Yes, there is a lot of requirements that are missing. I truly worked as hard as I could on this, though.

I appreciate your feedback and I look forward to getting this grade.
